# tiktok-hide-share
## For when you just want to share a tiktok, not your profile + other intrusive trackers inside of the link.
### What is it doing?
It is taking your provided share-link (for example: [vm.tiktok.com/ZMjLCdn2V](vm.tiktok.com/ZMjLCdn2V)) *(which is just found from some reddit post)*.

Upon opening the link, the real expanded link will appear in the address bar. There you will see, that it is not just linking to the video on the creator's profile, but instead also providing the information of which user it was shared by. As well as various other information for tiktok's own analytics.

Often times, the trackers at the end of the link are quite long, and require an annoying effort, to select only the relevant part. This is exactly why this website exists now.

### The differences:
Lets take as a base, the same link from reddit [vm.tiktok.com/ZMjLCdn2V](vm.tiktok.com/ZMjLCdn2V)
1. The link that appears when you select "Share" => "Copy Link" from inside of tiktok
**vm.tiktok.com/ZMjLCdn2V**

2. <p>The link that it expands to, upon opening it:<br>
[**www.tiktok.com/@trippybeatt/video/7273343482721291563<br>?_t=8fI24GJcSEn&_r=1**](www.tiktok.com/@trippybeatt/video/7273343482721291563?_t=8fI24GJcSEn&_r=1)
	<br>
	Only the part left of the question-mark is required to share the video in reality. All the things after the question-mark are just trackers embedded into the link by TikTok.</p>

3. So the cleaned-up version of it would be:
**www.tiktok.com/@trippybeatt/video/7273343482721291563**

	This is also what you will get as output, from the website.
